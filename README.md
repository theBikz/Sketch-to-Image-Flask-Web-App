# Sketch-to-Image-Flask-Web-App
A Flask web app for generating realistic images from hand drawn sketches.


The Generation of realisitic images from hand drawn sketch is done by a conditional GAN model.
The code for building the GAN model is available at my another repo Sketch-to-Image-using-GANs-Keras
https://github.com/theBikz/Sketch-to-Image-using-GANs-Keras

Update the folder data with the trained model. Also update the paths mentioned in the app.py
